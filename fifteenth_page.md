# I canâ€™t describe the assumptions of my analysis or statistical release, when they were made and who made them and signed them off


All analysis involves assumptions. Understanding what those are (and being clear how and why you made them) is critical for understanding why the analysis works the way it does. Keeping a log of the assumptions you make, when you made them and who agreed them is a really helpful way to keep track of this.
