# My colleagues never challenge me about the results I produce.


People working with your results will have expectations about what the results will be and observed departures from these expectations are an important part of the QA process. An independent layer of QA, possibly including a curiosity-type session will help with this assurance. This can be on the overall results or a component, e.g for a sector or for the latest set of weights.

Here are some additional resources that might help
