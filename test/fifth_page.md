# What is the quality of the data that you use?



Understanding the quality of your data inputs is critical. It enables you to assess limitations and uncertainty in the inputs and how they feed through to your outputs. If you don't understand this, you will be unable to assess the quality of your process or your outputs. Understanding the quality of the data will allow you to assess whether the data can be used to address your analytical questions and the underlying user needs.
