# Quality Questions and Red Flags

This document is published and maintained by the Data Quality Hub and the Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub.

It aims to provide support to colleagues working on statistical outputs and analysis in ONS.

The tab 'Quality Questions' include a set of questions that the analyst can use to interrogate their work with their team, and will support them in assuring the quality of their work. The document explains why the question is important, and what help, guidance, and support is available.

The tab 'Quality Red Flags' include a set of statements that can help the analyst and their team to identify potential risks to quality that might benefit from further look into. These statements are not meant to be considered as a value judgment, but more as a suggestion that best practice and support could be beneficial.

If you have any questions or feedback about this document, please reach out to the Data Quality Hub or the Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub. We will keep this updated and we always welcome any input from anyone working on statistical releases or analysis to ensure this document can be the most helpful possible.

## Quality Questions


| Quality Question  | Why do I need to know the answer to this? | What help is available here? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| What is the need for this analysis or statistical release?  |  Understanding why the analysis/statistical release is needed and what it will be used for is critical for understanding whether what you have done is fit for purpose. If you are responsible for part of an analytical/statistical process, understanding the end use will help you to make sure that your part does what is needed to meet user needs. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Guidance: Analysis Functional Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-analysis-functional-standard--2) <br> > [Get in touch with the User Research team]()
| Who uses your analysis or statistical release? | Understanding who uses your analysis/statistical release will help you to make sure that it meets their needs. It also helps you to tailor your outputs to make sure all your users are fully supported in using the outputs effectively. | > [Guidance: User engagement top tips](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-top-tips/) <br> > Get in touch with the User Research team and the [External Affairs team](mailto:External.Affairs@ons.gov.uk) 
| What analytical question you are addressing? | Having a clear understanding of the problem your team is trying to solve ensures that the analysis you design is fit for purpose. If you do not know how your work is contributing to answering an analytical need, you may be unaware of important requirements or limitations for your part of the work. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Guidance: Analysis Functional Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-analysis-functional-standard--2) <br> > Get in touch with the User Research team and the [External Affairs team](mailto:External.Affairs@ons.gov.uk) 
| What is the quality of the data that you use? | Understanding the quality of your data inputs is critical. It enables you to assess limitations and uncertainty in the inputs and how they feed through to your outputs. If you don't understand this, you will be unable to assess the quality of your process or your outputs. Understanding the quality of the data will allow you to assess whether the data can be used to address your analytical questions and the underlying user needs. | > [The Government Data Quality Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework) <br> >  [Introduction to data quality](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Introduction_to_Data_Quality/) <br> > [Introduction to data quality assessments](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Introduction_to_data_quality_assessments/) <br> > [Tips for urgent quality assurance of data](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/tips-for-urgent-quality-assurance-of-data/) <br> > [Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) toolkit](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/) <br> > [Quality of Admin Data in Statistics (Draft guidance)](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/admin-data-quality-stats/index.html) <br> > [Data Quality Action Plans](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Data-Quality-Action-Plans/) <br> > [Data Quality Dimensions](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/meet-the-data-quality-dimensions) <br> > [Quality Assurance: Four Areas of Practice](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/quality-assurance-four-key-areas-of-practice/) <br> > Get in touch with the [Data Quality Hub](mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk) 
| How did you choose the methods for the analysis or statistical release? | You should be able to explain why you chose the method (or set of methods) that you are using to produce your analysis or statistical release. A clear rationale for your method gives you and your users confidence that your choice is based on sound reasoning and evidence. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Guidance: Analysis Functional Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-analysis-functional-standard--2) <br> > Get in touch with the [Anakysis Standards and Pipelines Hub](mailto:External.Affairs@ons.gov.uk) and the [Methodology Advisory Service (MAS)](mailto:MAS@ons.gov.uk)
| How do you know the method you are using is appropriate? | You should be able to explain why the method(s) you use are suitable for this analysis/statistical release and be able to support your choice with evidence. This might include reference to academic peer review or other projects that are similar. If you can't explain why you chose the methods you use and why they are right for your analysis and the data you are using, you cannot be sure that your approach is sound. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > Get in touch with the [Methodology Advisory Service (MAS)](mailto:MAS@ons.gov.uk) 
| Can you summarise and explain the end-to-end process of your analysis or statistical release for somebody who asks about it? | Having an overview of your analysis/statistical release (especially if you only work on part of it) ensures that you and your team understand how your work feeds into the wider product. It can help you to identify potential quality risks or issues, both upstream and downstream of your own work as well as how your activity supports and underpins downstream processing. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Generic-Statistical-Business-Process-Model.pdf) 
| How do you know that your analysis or statistical process is working correctly? | You need to be sure that your analysis produces the outputs that you think it should and that the processes you run work as expected. If you cannot demonstrate that scripts and processes you have set up are functioning correctly, you cannot confirm the quality of the results. | > [Guidance: Verification and validation for the AQUA Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verification-and-validation-for-the-aqua-book) <br> > Get in touch with the [Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub](mailto:External.Affairs@ons.gov.uk) 
| Would another analyst be able to pick up from where you left off and reproduce or continue the work (without talking to you first)? | Your analysis must be well documented so that somebody new can understand it and pick it up. Poor documentation means that other people will not understand why the process is configured as it is, how the process works or how to run the process safely - potentially leading to errors. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Guidance QA of Code for Analysis and Research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) <br> > Get in touch with the [Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub](mailto:ASAP@ons.gov.uk)
| If you find a mistake in your analysis, do you have a clear and efficient process for addressing the issue and preventing it from happening again? | Analysis with lots of manual steps or that uses several tools is usually hard to assure. When problems happen, finding out how and why can be really difficult, and this does not apply only to manual processing. If your process is in this category, you are probably carrying extra quality risks. | > [Guidance: Analysis Functional Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-analysis-functional-standard--2) <br> > [Guidance QA of Code for Analysis and Research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) <br> > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > Get in touch with the [Statistics Head of Profession Office](mailto:stat.hopoffice@ons.gov.uk) and/or the [Quality Champions Network](mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk)
| Do you consistently use peer review to check scripts and code, documentation, implementation of methods, processes and outputs? | Peer review is a standard part of analysis best practice. It is helpful because it helps to identify where steps are unclear, documents are hard to understand or there might be problems with calculations or implementation of methods. Routine peer review helps to improve the quality of processes and to reduce risk by identifying potential problems. | > [Guidance: Quality assurance of code for analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) <br> > [Guidance: Quality statistics in government](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/quality-statistics-in-government/#quality-assurance) <br> > Get in touch with the [Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub](mailto:ASAP@ons.gov.uk) (scripts, code, and documentation, peer review of models), the [Data Quality Hub](mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk) (processes and outputs), and the [Methodology Advisory Service](mailto:MAS@ons.gov.uk) (methods).
| What are the limitations of your analysis or statistical release? | You should be able to explain any issues or limitations with your analysis/statistical release, and how they impact on potential use. A formal log of issues and limitations is a good way to make sure everybody in the team understands potential problems. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > Get in touch with the [Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub](mailto:External.Affairs@ons.gov.uk) 
| Could you give a clear account of what can and cannot be inferred from your analysis or statistical release? | Ultimately our analysis/statistical releases should inform public commentary and decisions taken. A clear statement of the extent to which the analysis does and does not support these will help reduce the chance of errors in these actions. | > [Guidance: Communicating quality, uncertainty and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [e-learning: Communicating quality, uncertainty, and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > Get in touch with the [Analysis Standards Hub](mailto:ASAP@ons.gov.uk) and [Pipelines Hub and the Methodology Advisory Service](mailto:MAS@ons.gov.uk) (MAS)
| Have you assessed the impact of the limitations and set out how they will affect the quality and use of the outputs? | Where you have identified limitations (for example data quality issues) you should be able to explain how they impact on the quality of the analysis. If you cannot, you do not know how good the output is. | > [e-learning: Communicating quality, uncertainty, and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > Get in touch with the [Data Quality Hub](mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk) and the [Pipelines Hub and the Methodology Advisory Service](mailto:MAS@ons.gov.uk) (MAS)
| How do you measure and report uncertainty in your analysis or statistical release? | No analysis is perfect and no data are completely correct. You should be able to explain how you have assessed and measured the uncertainty that affects your analysis. | > [Guidance: Communicating quality, uncertainty and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [e-learning: Communicating quality, uncertainty, and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > Get in touch with the [Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub](mailto:ASAP@ons.gov.uk) and the [Data Quality Hub](mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk)
| What is the assessment of the quality of your analytical outputs? | Understanding and reporting on the quality of your analytical outputs is critical to ensure fitness for purpose, as well as trust and reliability. This ensures that analysis can appropriately inform decision-making. Your quality assessments are also key information to be shared with your users (for instance, through the Quality and Methodology Information Reports - QMIs) as well as being a requirement of the Code of Practice for Statistics. | > [Guidance: Quality statistics in government](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/quality-statistics-in-government/) <br> > [Tips for urgent quality assurance of ad-hoc analysis](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/top-tips-for-quality-assuring-urgent-pieces-of-ad-hoc-statistical-analysis/) <br> > [Guidelines for measuring statistical quality](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/docs-nqaf/UK-Guidelines_Subject.pdf) <br> > [Mandatory training on Quality Statistics in government](https://learninghub.ons.gov.uk/enrol/index.php?id=1497) <br> > [Mandatory introductory training on Code of Practice](https://learninghub.ons.gov.uk/enrol/index.php?id=1094) <br> > For support and advice, get in touch with the [Data Quality Hub](mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk)
